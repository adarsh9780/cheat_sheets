Hey Shankar,

I am working in Mu Sigma as Trainee Decision Scientist for more than 1.5 years now.

I have worked on multiple end-to-end data science projects.
I led a team of 5 people to build a classification model to predict the probability of default. This helped us to pick the right cardholder for whom we can increase the credit limit automatically without any manual intervention. This led the client to save $2M per year.

Within my short period of time in Mu Sigma, I won 2 SPOT award for my work.

I have prior experience in web development using Django, which makes me more relevant to this job. I can write clean, optimized and production-ready code.

My relevant experience makes me an ideal candidate for this job.

Thank you
